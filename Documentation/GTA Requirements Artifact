Group 7 is wanting to create a Javascript desktop application that is a stock/crypto/online token tracking dashboard. The application will have three pages:

The Dashboard
A collection of the users “favorited currencies” (haven’t found a name yet to generalize them all).
Each currencies section will have a graph that can be toggled between 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.
Each section will also allow the user to set a price point for that currency and will be sent an email notification if it rises or falls to that point.
Search Page
This page will allow the user to browse all stocks, crypto, and online tokens.
They will be shown a graph of the currency with the same timeframes of the dashboard.
The user can also add the currency to their favorites on the dashboard.
Biggest Winners/Losers
This page will show top 10 biggest winners and losers for stocks and cryptos for the current day.
 

We will be using HTML to create the GUI elements. We are also going to use Finnhub's API to retrieve stock and crypto data, and Blizzards api to track WoW tokens.

 

In Project 3, we are wanting to get the GUI set up for the graphs and multiple pages. Wewill be implementing
a very basic class for the api’s as we will just use one stock to gather template time series data.

 

In Project 4, we will fully build the api classes to gather any data needed. As well as, implementing the price point tracking and email notifications.
